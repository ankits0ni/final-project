| 01                | Authorization & Authentication Validation | Confirm that critical operations are restricted to authorized users only.                       | - Attempt unauthorized access to critical functions.<br>- Test different user roles (admin, regular user, guest) to perform operations.<br>- Assess the password policies, focusing on reuse and complexity.<br>- Investigate the system for vulnerabilities like session fixation and hijacking. | Unauthorized users are blocked from accessing critical functions. Strong password policies and secure session management are enforced. |
| 02                | Secured Data Transmission             | Ensure secure transmission of data between the client and server.                              | - Validate the use of HTTPS for all data exchanges.<br>- Conduct a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to detect possible data interception.<br>- Verify the proper implementation of SSL/TLS protocols and certificates. | All data is securely transmitted, preventing any unauthorized interception or tampering. |
| 03                | Secure Data Storage                   | Verify that sensitive data is securely stored in databases or file systems.                    | - Check that passwords are encrypted when stored.<br>- Review cookies, local storage, and session storage for sensitive information.<br>- Confirm the use of encryption keys and secure storage techniques.<br>- Examine logs for potential data leaks. | Sensitive data is encrypted and securely stored, with no leakage through logs or other methods. |
| 04                | Session Management Security           | Validate the security and integrity of session management.                                    | - Attempt to manipulate session IDs for session fixation.<br>- Ensure sessions expire after inactivity and that automatic logout is enabled.<br>- Secure session cookies with HTTPOnly and Secure flags.<br>- Try to hijack a session using obtained session IDs or cookies. | Secure session management with enforced timeouts, secured cookies, and protection against session fixation and hijacking. |
| 05                | Input Validation & Data Sanitization  | Ensure that data input is properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.                     | - Test for SQL injection by entering harmful SQL commands.<br>- Test for XSS by injecting malicious scripts.<br>- Identify vulnerabilities related to command injection.<br>- Ensure all user inputs are sanitized and validated before processing. | The application sanitizes and validates all inputs, preventing SQL injection, XSS, and command injection attacks. |
| 06                | Access Control Testing                | Confirm that users can only access functions and data they are authorized to use.              | - Attempt to access other users' data without proper authorization.<br>- Test for privilege escalation both vertically and horizontally.<br>- Verify that access controls are enforced both on the client-side and server-side. | Users are restricted to authorized data and functions only, with no unauthorized privilege escalation. |
| 07                | API Security Validation               | Assess the security of the application's APIs.                                                | - Verify that APIs enforce proper authentication and authorization.<br>- Check if APIs expose sensitive data.<br>- Test for denial-of-service (DoS) protection using throttling and rate-limiting.<br>- Validate the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration. | APIs are secure with proper authentication, authorization, data protection, and DoS prevention. |
